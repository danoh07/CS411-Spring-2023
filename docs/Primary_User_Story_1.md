### As a regular user, I want to be able to easily search for a playlist by entering its name into a search bar. The platform should use both the Spotify and Youtube APIs to grab playlists that match my search query and display the results in a column layout that is easy to read and navigate. This will allow me to quickly find the playlist I am looking for and convert it to my preferred format or simply listen to it on the platform.

### As a logged-in user, I want to be able to follow other users and their playlists, so that I can stay updated on their latest music recommendations. The platform should allow me to search for other users by name or username, and provide a "follow" button that allows me to subscribe to their playlists. The followed users' playlists should appear in a dedicated "following" section in my account, and I should receive notifications when they add new songs or create new playlists.

### As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see my account settings, so that I can update my personal information and preferences. The platform should provide a user settings page that is easily accessible from any page of the platform. This page should display a list of settings and options that I can customize based on my preferences.

### The "Profile Information" section should allow me to update my name, email address, and password. It should also allow me to add or change my profile picture and to update my bio or description.

### The "Preferences" section should allow me to customize my platform preferences such as notification settings, and theme (e.g. light or dark mode). It should also allow me to manage my privacy settings such as who can view my playlists and who can send me friend requests. Overall, the account settings page should provide me with complete control over my personal information and preferences.

### As a logged-in user of a music conversion platform, I want to be able to share my converted playlists with other users, so that they can enjoy the same music as me. The platform should provide a "share" option that allows me to share my converted playlist with other users via email, social media, or a shareable link. The shared playlist should be accessible to anyone with the link, but only editable by me.

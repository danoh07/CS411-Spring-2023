As a regular user, I want to know which songs or how many songs have been unsuccessful in converting from one format to another. This makes it so I am aware of what songs are lacking or corrupted in my newly converted playlist, thus being aware of the differences between the converted playlist to the original playlist. The user should also be notified if a song being converted to a saved playlist is a duplicate to let me know if a song is accidentally (or intentionally) being added/converted more than once.

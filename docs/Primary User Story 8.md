As a logged-in user, I want to be able to select which songs to add or remove from a saved pre-existing playlist, which would make saved playlists more customizable. This would make it so updating or customising a playlist is less tedious of a process for the user, and can be done quickly without much hassle. Remove songs can simply be selecting a specific/specific group of songs to remove from a saved playlist. To add songs, users should be able to use a search query or upload either a Spotify/YouTube link to a song that a user wants to convert directly to a saved playlist.

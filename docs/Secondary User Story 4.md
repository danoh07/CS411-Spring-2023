### As a logged-in user, I want to be able to rate and review converted playlists, so that I can share my feedback with other users. The platform should provide a user rating and review system that is easy to use and accessible from the playlist details page. To rate and review a converted playlist, I should be able to click on a button or link that takes me to the rating and review section. The section should allow me to give a rating out of five stars, as well as leave a written review of my experience with the playlist.

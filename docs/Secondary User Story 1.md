### As a regular user, I want to be able to switch to dark mode, so that I can use the app in low-light conditions without straining my eyes. The platform should provide a "theme" option in the user settings that allows me to switch between a light mode and a dark mode. When I select the dark mode, the platform should update its interface to use a dark color scheme that is easier on my eyes in low-light conditions. The dark mode interface should be consistent across all pages of the platform, and should not affect the functionality of the platform. The platform should use high-contrast colors and readable fonts to ensure that the text and images are easily visible even in low-light conditions. The dark mode should be easily toggleable from any page of the platform, and the platform should remember my preference and apply it every time I log in.

### As a regular user, I want to be able to upload my playlist from Spotify or Youtube so that I can convert it to another format easily. The platform should have a dedicated page that shows my saved playlist that allows me to select the playlist I want to convert the playlist into a different platform. Once selected, the platform should take each music in the playlist and make a API call for a seach querey of the music and add or make a new playlist in the platform that is being converted to. The platform should then display the extracted playlist data in a user-friendly manner, allowing me to preview my converted playlist, so that I can ensure that it is correct before converting it. The there should be "Convert button" Once the conversion is complete, it should return the link of the playlist.
